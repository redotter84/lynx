# Lynx translator

Translator from my programming language Lynx to an assembly language, 2016 â€“ 2017.

## What is it

This application was implemented for a school students conference.

It is a translator from my programming language to an assembly language (MASM32).

The programming language Lynx was designed specifically for this project. It does not have any possible uses in the production, so I will not describe its features.
