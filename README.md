# Lynx translator

Translator from my programming language Lynx to an assembly language, 2016 â€“ 2017.

## What is it

This application was designed for a school students conference. The programming language Lynx was created specifically for this project. It does not have any possible uses in the production, so I will not describe its features.

This software is a tool to make assembly (MASM32) files from the Lynx code. If you have this assembler on your machine, you can compile it to an executable file.
